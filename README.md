meeting two - my initial thought is that it makes the most sense to handle converting the p5 output to something the contract can handle on the front end then passing that through as call data to the mint function to make this reasonably gas efficient. I have no basis for that other than, itâ€™s 9am, im tired, and your email did not find me well. 

on the algorithm. i have always been fascinated by how seemingly complex things in nature can be represented with seemingly simple math. i found  an algorithm for diffusion-limited aggregation in an old textbook and ran with that to get something up quickly. p5... simple, quick, react friendly. will it cause complications down the road? almost certainly.  

how tf am i going to do the animation onchain lmfao looking like it might be eight meetings.

img and the quote will need to be captured on the mint button click. each as metadata props. SSTORE? maybe each circle gets a unique id and (x,y) prop? 

meeting three - added more jargon. fully abandonded p5 and PIVOTED(lol) to vanillajs and directly creating the svgs. outputs are currently ~71kb. I have no idea what this means for gas cost at the moment, but seems fine...?

meeting four - 

meeting five -
